Arduino Designer
================

The **Arduino Designer** is born from our desire to give kids a tool to code the real world and from our aspiration to make [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/) accessible to them. The idea was to develop a new software to allow kids to create small programs for [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/). Our first action was to simplify the Eclipse UI, the project lifecycle and to provide a graphical block language to be able to develop simple programs and run them on electronic modules. The purpose is to provide a simple dedicated tool which gives the possibility to discover the effects a software program can have on electronic modules. The Arduino Designer is based on the [Sirius](http://eclipse.org/sirius/index.html) project which allows to create really easily graphical designer.

These plugins are released under the EPL Open-Source License.
